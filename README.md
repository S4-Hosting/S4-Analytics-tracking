# S4-Analytics-tracking

WordPress plugin to implement a tracking code for Matomo analytics.

The plugin is designed to be light, fast, basic and pretty optionless, it's a set and forget kind of solution. There are other alternatives out there if you want them to do something more advanced or have lots of options to play with. 

Tested up to WordPress 6.2 and Matomo 4.11.0

It's based on the 'Tracking code for Matomo, by Sergio Santos' WP plugin.
